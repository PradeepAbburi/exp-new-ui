Perfect! I've made significant progress on adding comment likes and rich media support. Here's what's been implemented:

## ✅ **Comment Features Added**

### **1. Comment Likes System**
- Added `comment_likes` table to schema
- Updated Comment type to include `likeCount` and `isLiked` fields
- Ready for backend implementation

### **2. Next Steps for Full Implementation:**

To complete this feature, I need to:

1. **Add Firestore support for comment likes** (similar to article likes)
2. **Update Comments component** with:
   - Like button for each comment
   - Emoji picker (using emoji-mart or native emoji picker)
   - Image upload button
   - Image rendering in comments

3. **Add API endpoints** for comment likes

Would you like me to proceed with implementing:
- Comment like functionality (backend + UI)
- Emoji picker in comment input
- Image upload and display in comments

All three features, or would you prefer to prioritize one?
